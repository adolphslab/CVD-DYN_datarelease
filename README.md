Key Features of the study:
Longitudinal data: 
Data was collected at 16 time points between April 2020 and Jannaury 2021 to track socioemotional/ behavioral changes across teh COVID pandemic.
COVID-Dynamic test battery:
The self-report questionnaire battery included commonly used, published psychological assessment instruments and race-related surveys. 
We also administered a variety of self-report questionnaires created specifically for this study to characterize experiences (e.g., direct exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19 illness amongst family and friends, more general COVID-19-related changes to daily life) and attitudes (e.g., towards masking, government-mandated restrictions, the killing of George Floyd, etc.) related to COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, as well as demographic surveys and experimental questionnaires related to new and ongoing research (see Measures - Measures Created by COVID-Dynamic Team).
Tasks:
In addition to questionnaires, participants completed a series of computer-based tasks designed to assess implicit social attitudes towards race (specifically Black/White/Asian) and pro-sociality, as well as estimations of COVID-related trustworthiness, and social decisions related to pro-sociality, group-cohesion, and altruism. 
Demographic data:
FOr each participant we provide detailed demographic information, as well as raking weights to weight the sample to match the demographics of the US population more closely. 
External measures: 
External measures In addition to data collected from participants, we aggregated data from a variety of external sources and linked the external data to the COVID-Dynamic data-collection-schedule, and participantsâ€™ individual wave-by-wave physical locations (US-state and county).
